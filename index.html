            Coffee is a beverage produce
            d from the roasted beans of the coffee tree. It is traditionally served hot, but can also be eaten chilled.
            Coffee is a stimulant because it contains caffeine—usually 80 to 140 mg for every 207 ml depending on the method of preparation. Studies have shown that people who drink four 
            cups of coffee a day have a lower risk of dying from a heart attack. The 13/04th is world coffee day.
            In some periods of the 1980s, coffee was the second most traded commodity in the world by monetary value, after oil. This statistic is still widely quoted, but it has been inaccurate for about two decades, due to the fall in the price of coffee during the coffee crisis in the 1990s, reducing the total value of its exports. In 2003, 
            coffee was the seventh most important agricultural export in terms of value, behind crops such as wheat, corn and soybeans.
